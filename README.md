# Full Stack Module Coursework: Gym Workout Record System

Welcome to the repository for the Full Stack Module coursework, where we embark on the exciting journey of building a comprehensive Gym Workout Record System. This project is designed to showcase your proficiency in constructing a fully functional full-stack system that meets a set of rigorous requirements.

## Project Requirements

Your project must meet the following stringent requirements to demonstrate a well-rounded understanding of full-stack development:

1. **Dynamic Web Technologies:**

2. **Node.js Server:**
   - Develop a server using Node.js exclusively. This server will act as the backbone of your application, handling requests from the client, managing data, and facilitating communication between different components.

3. **Database Implementation:**
   - Utilize either MongoDB as the database to store information. The database should be integrated with the server through a well-defined API, allowing for efficient data retrieval and storage.

4. **WebSockets Communication:**
   - Implement WebSockets to enable real-time communication between two clients. This feature will enhance the interactive nature of the system, allowing users to collaborate and share updates seamlessly.

5. **JavaScript (with or without TypeScript):**
   - Use JavaScript as the main development language for both client-side and server-side components. This requirement ensures consistency and cohesion throughout the entire stack.

6. **Interactive System:**
   - Develop an interactive system where users can actively engage with the application. Support for input devices such as keyboards and mice should be seamlessly integrated to enhance user interaction.

7. **Distributed System:**
   - Ensure that the system is distributed and can run on multiple computers. Stand-alone applications are not permitted, emphasizing the importance of creating a scalable and widely accessible solution.

8. **CRUD Functionality for Multiple Entities:**
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for at least four entities, with each group member responsible for one entity. This collaborative approach ensures a diverse range of features and functionalities within the Gym Workout Record System.

9. **Security Considerations:**
   - Incorporate appropriate security measures, including a login system, to safeguard user data and ensure a secure environment for gym-goers to track their workouts.
